		<h2>About</h2>
		<p>Hi! My name is Colin Gilbert. I am a computer programmer based in Regina, Saskatchewan.</p>
		<p>If you are reading this this, odds are that you're either looking into my cool projects or deciding whether you or your firm wants to work alongside me. I am <i>very</i> invested in my education and tend to become very knowledgeable in fields that must be understood in order to fulfill other needs.</p>
		<p>Among the nicer things I have been called more than once: Good communicator, good teacher, good person, extremely bright, respectful, very intelligent, silly, brave, funny.</p>
		<h4>Interests (professional)</h4>
		<ul>
			<li>Systems Programming</li>
			<li>Organizing data</li>
			<li>Building the most effective UIs</li>
			<li>Design and implementation of extremely reliable and secure hardware-software-network-process assemblies.</li>
		</ul>
		<h4>Interests (STEM-related)</h4>
		<ul>
			<li>3D printing, machining, automated assembly</li>
			<li>AI and Data Science</li>
			<li>Materials</li>
			<li>Trying to do things such as Kolmogorov complexity and exponential growth analyses on non-computer science concepts</li>
			<li>People's perceptions of technology vs. what it actually is</li>
		</ul>
		<h4>Interests (what I fancy)</h4>
		<ul>
			<li>Gardening</li>
			<li>Sewing, dyeing, tailoring, leatherwork, upholstery, felting. I will reliably nerd out for anything fabric-related.</li>
			<li>Cooking</li>
			<li>Music</li>
			<li>History. I've read that studying history makes you a better scientist, and I agree - understanding history is about finding the greater context, sometimes with mere scraps of information, from disparate sources. It also shows us with real examples how much information is needed to accurately piece together any kind of meaningful picture.</li>
			<li>Dogs. I'm a sucker for floppy faces.</li>
		</ul>
		<h4>Projects (ongoing)</h4>
		<ul>
			<li>FIT/ME - Food Intake Track/Measure Exercise - The customizable calorie tracker that you can run at home, at scale, and maybe one day on your kitchen scale!</li>
			<li>High temperature 3D printer</li>
			<li>NoobWerkz Engine</li>
		</ul>
		<h4>Projects past/in maintenance)</h4>
		<ul>
			<li>AutoGentoo build utilities</li>
			<li>Various utilities for file format massaging</li>
		</ul>

		<h4>Good works that everyone in the field should read at least once</h4>
		<p>Some of these were university textbooks that were in some manner more useful than the rest. Others are extremely informative works the authors have freely made available online. The rest weren't freely available nor a part of curriculum, but I managed to obtain them anyhow.</p>
		<ul>
			<li><i>Concrete Semantics with Isabelle/HOL</i> by Nickpow and Klein</li>
			<li><i>Elements of Programming</i> by Stepanov and McJones</li>
			<li><i>Concepts of Programming Languages</i> by Sebesta</li>
			<li><i>Stewart's Calculus</i> by the late James Stewart. I wanted to personally thank him but never got to.</li>
			<li><i>Introduction to Mathematical Thinking</i> by Gilbert and Vanstone</li>
			<li><i>Practical Linear Algebra</i> by Farin and Hansford</li>
		</ul>
		<h4>Things I'd like to do.</h4>
		<ul>
			<li>A P2P system to timestamp and sign small files, for the purpose of notarizing.</li>
			<li>A time-slicing OS written in a memory-safe language with strong formal modeling. While I do not wish to marry this to any specific technology or technique, it will likely use the underjack approach as well as careful memory access patterns to defend against memory unsafety, cache timing attacks, and rowhammer. Strict enforcement of dataflow will be established and enforced within each computer and across the network via ephemeral IP addresses, a strict encrypt-until-needed policy for everything except some public keys, and a Kerberos-like system plugged into a capabilities-based authorization database. Some dislike Kerberos due to the difficulties in integration and the network chatter it can cause, but if you do it right (more on that in a later post!) I contend it is more future-ready than most others (with justification in said post!)</li>
			<li>Offer coding lessons on YouTube.</li>
			<li>Make a few nice blazers.</li>
			<li>Learn pattern-drafting. Build a camera assembly that creates a point-cloud and turns it into pattern blocks. Make clothes for myself and all my friends.</li>
			<li>Old-fashioned shoemaking.</li>
			<li>Paint on silk.</li>
			<li>Write, animate, and voice an online show.</li>
			<li>Make a machine that can assemble items made of diverse materials, as well as an automated feeder system that fetches, cuts, 3D-prints, etc.</li>
			<li>Create online strategy games of great depth and cultivate a fanbase of very intelligent people.</li>
			<li>Compile and share a database of my knowledge. Encourage others to contribute.</li>
		</ul>
		<h4>Credentials (obtained)</h4>
		<ul>
			<li>A+ Certification. 2003</li>
			<li>High School Diploma. Mgr. de Laval. Regina, Saskatchewan, Canada. 2004</li>
			<li>(Pending) BSc. Computer Science, University of Regina, Saskatchewan, Canada</li>
		</ul>
		<h4>Credentials (currently working on)</h4>
		<p>Unlike some software devs, I believe that certs hold value if they are chosen carefully. Here is my current shortlist:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>CTT+ (Certified Technical Trainer), from CompTIA</li>
			<li>CAPM (Certified Associate in Project Management), from PMBOK</li>
		</ol>
		<h4>Experiences</h4>
		<p>This is where a prospective colleague will express the noteworthy things they've done over the past years. Hiring personel performing due diligence may notice a gap between milestones. I fell very ill for several years while nobody listened. For about half a decade I lived in a sort of suspended state with sub-marginal well-being. It then took another five years or so to relearn social skills and executive function, as these had been mostly tabula rasa'd by what had happened.</p>
		<p>However, from June 2016 to August 2017 I was the computer technician at London Drugs Harbour Landing in Regina. I was often roped in to sell, and was able to provide unexpectedly good service to customers expecting a lot less from me. It was there where I started learning how to speak with non-technical people. I also discovered a liking towards consulting - people wanted to see me specifically because they knew I was both honest and extremely knowledgeable. Talking to customers there also gave me ideas for various products and services I intend to offer someday.</p>
		<h4>Languages</h4>
		<p>My first language is French but most people don't know that.</p>
		<p>Computer-wise, the first language I played with at age 12 was Perl, followed by HTML/CSS/JavaScript from the WebMonkey tutorials. Then I read Head-First Java 1.4 at age 14 and really enjoyed using the Swing GUI toolkit. Later on I did more hardware work and learned a lot of C/C++. Sometimes I'm amazed at what some people (ab)used that language to accomplish! I have also really enjoyed ARM assembly at university and I'm not at all afraid of diving right back into low-level work! Recently I've been scripting in Python a lot. Over the past few months I've been looking at Ada/SPARK, Rust, and CakeML as tools for writing extremely solid software. I have also lately been reading up on Isabelle/HOL for the purposes of learning formal verification.</p>
		<h4>Beliefs</h4>
		<ul>
			<li>Emotional cruelty should be outlawed and enforced against.</li>
			<li>AI is both currently overhyped and underestimated. The long-term changes will still be fundamental, but they'll happen more quietly as it becomes normalized.</li>
			<li>Same as previous, but substitute "AI" with "blockchain." Isn't it interesting how usage patterns form around powerful technology?</li>
			<li>P != NP. Probably...</li>
			<li>If you find yourself asking "Why didn't someone build this important thing we need?" it's usually a cost issue.</li>
			<li>People often get too religious about technology, but high-quality open-source hardware and software is extremely important to the field. Having been bitten by poor firmware support for business-grade hardware, I have committed to never buy closed-source hardware again if an open-source alternative exists. Due to my capacities as a computer programmer I'd be able to assist the community.</li>
			<li>I will cheerfully work with all sorts of different people and groups and will even do pro-bono for certain causes. However, I will not partake in socially toxic or criminal endeavours.</li>
			<li>The future of programming languages lies in formal verification; our own is predicated on how well we deploy human languages.</li>
