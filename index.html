		<h2>About</h2>
		<p>Hi! My name is Colin Gilbert. I am a very competent computer programmer based in Regina, Saskatchewan.</p>
		<p>If you are reading this this, odds are that you're looking into my cool projects or deciding whether you or your firm wants to work alongside me. I am <i>very</i> invested in my education and tend to become very knowledgeable in fields that must be understood in order to fulfill other needs.</p>
		<p>Among the nicer things I have been called more than once: Good communicator, good teacher, good person, extremely bright, respectful, very intelligent, silly, brave, funny.</p>
		<h4>Interests (professional)</h4>
		<ul>
			<li>Systems Programming</li>
			<li>Organizing data</li>
			<li>Building the most effective UIs</li>
			<li>Design and implementation of extremely reliable and secure hardware-software-network-process assemblies: I wish to make computer security and mental health compatible.</li>
		</ul>
		<h4>Interests (STEM-related)</h4>
		<ul>
			<li>3D printing, machining, automated assembly</li>
			<li>AI and Data Science</li>
			<li>Materials</li>
			<li>Trying to do things such as Kolmogorov complexity and exponential growth analyses on non-computer science concepts</li>
			<li>People's perceptions of technology vs. what it actually is</li>
		</ul>
		<h4>Interests (what I fancy)</h4>
		<ul>
			<li>Gardening</li>
			<li>Sewing, dyeing, tailoring, leatherwork, upholstery, felting. I nerd out for anything fabric-related.</li>
			<li>Cooking</li>
			<li>Music</li>
			<li>History. I've read that studying history makes you a better scientist, and I agree - understanding history is about finding the greater context, sometimes with mere scraps of information, from disparate sources. It also shows us with real examples how much information is needed to accurately piece together any kind of meaningful picture.</li>
			<li>Dogs</li>
		</ul>
		<h4>Projects (ongoing)</h4>
		<ul>
			<li>FIT/ME - Food Intake Track/Measure Exercise - The customizable calorie tracker that you can run at home, at scale, and maybe one day on your kitchen scale!</li>
			<li>AutoGentoo build utilities</li>
			<li>High temperature 3D printer</li>
			<li>NoobWerkz Engine</li>
		</ul>
		<h4>Projects past/in maintenance)</h4>
			<p>Various utilities for file format massaging</p>
		<h4>Good works that everyone in the field should read at least once</h4>
		<p>Some of these were university textbooks that were in some manner more useful than the rest. Others are extremely informative works the authors have freely made available online. The rest weren't freely available nor a part of curriculum, but I managed to obtain them anyhow.</p>
		<ul>
			<li><i>Concrete Semantics with Isabelle/HOL</i> by Nickpow and Klein</li>
			<li><i>Elements of Programming</i> by Stepanov and McJones</li>
			<li><i>Concepts of Programming Languages</i> by Sebesta</li>
			<li><i>Stewart's Calculus</i> by the late James Stewart. I wanted to personally thank him but never got to.</li>
			<li><i>Introduction to Mathematical Thinking</i> by Gilbert and Vanstone</li>
			<li><i>Practical Linear Algebra</i> by Farin and Hansford</li>
		</ul>
		<h4>Things I'd like to do.</h4>
		<ul>
			<li>A P2P system to timestamp and sign small files, for the purpose of notarizing.</li>
			<li>A time-slicing OS written in a memory-safe language with strong formal modeling. While I do not wish to marry this to any specific technology or technique, it will likely use the underjack approach as well as careful memory access patterns to defend against memory unsafety, cache timing attacks, and rowhammer. Strict enforcement of dataflow will be established and enforced within each computer and across the network via ephemeral IP addresses, a strict encrypt-until-needed policy for everything except some public keys, and a Kerberos-like system plugged into a capabilities-based authorization database. Some dislike Kerberos due to the difficulties in integration and the network chatter it can cause, but if you do it right (more on that in a later post!) I contend it is more future-ready than most others (with justification in said post!)</li>
			<li>Offer coding lessons on YouTube.</li>
			<li>Learn how to make a very nice blazer.</li>
			<li>Learn pattern-drafting. Build a camera assembly that creates a point-cloud and turns it into pattern blocks. Make clothes for myself and all my friends.</li>
			<li>Learn old-fashioned shoemaking.</li>
			<li>Writing, animating, and voicing relevant and provocative online shows.</li>
			<li>Make a machine that can assemble items made of diverse materials, as well as an automated feeder system that fetches, cuts, 3D-prints, etc.</li>
			<li>Create online strategy games of great depth and cultivate a fanbase of very intelligent people.</li>
			<li>Compile and share a database of my knowledge. Encourage others to contribute.</li>
		</ul>
		<h4>Credentials (obtained)</h4>
		<ul>
			<li>A+ Certification. 2003</li>
			<li>High School Diploma. Mgr. de Laval. Regina, Saskatchewan, Canada. 2004</li>
			<li>B.Sc. Computer Science, University of Regina, Saskatchewan, Canada. Winter 2020</li>
		</ul>
		<h4>Credentials (currently working on)</h4>
		<p>Unlike some software devs, I believe that certs hold value if they are chosen carefully. Here is my current shortlist:</p>

			<li>CASP+ (Certified Advanced Security Professional), from CompTIA</li>
		</ol>
		<h4>Experiences</h4>
		<p>Trigger warning.</p>
		<p>This is where a prospective colleague will express the noteworthy things they've done over the past years. Hiring personel performing due diligence may notice a gap between milestones. Here is why: A few people who were deeply embedded in my community turned out to be extremely sadistic. The game was to do everything possible to get someone to suicide while maintaining plausible deniability. It was drawn out for a long time; for about half a decade I lived in a sort of suspended state and everyone else's studied ignorance. The trauma caused a personality split into a manic part and a dying part. There was zero well-being during much of that time. It then took another five years or so to relearn social skills and executive function, as they had been tabula rasa'd by what had happened. Since the primary aggressor was female, campus progressives to whom I spoke of this matter would often try to defend against a feared clawback of women's rights whereas a vocal minority of conservatives held a rather dim and misogynistic view of women that was equally unproductive. I kept silent until I could find the words for what happened. I really, <i>really</i> didn't want my experiences to become a hard-right propaganda piece: It was feminists who originally came up with the language to describe what I was living and they rightly called it a serious form of rape. I can offer this as evidence of gender studies being important, so let's not turn all this into even more insanity!</p>
		<p>During that time, from 2016 to 2017 I was the computer technician at London Drugs Harbour Landing in Regina. I was often roped in to sell, and was able to provide unexpectedly good service to customers expecting a lot less from me. It was there where I started learning how to speak with non-technical people. I also discovered my passion for consulting - the customers wanted to see me specifically because they knew I was both honest and extremely knowledgeable. I'm certain to have helped many understand their digital world better. From seeing the uncertainty in their eyes, I realized there is a gigantic potential market for honest and reliable teachers, consultants, vendors, and service providers. Customers really <i>really</i> wanted to be able to trust their tools, and I don't think they often do. I want to prosper by meeting such needs.</p>
		<p>I made and implemented the decision that this brutalization I had to live through wouldn't twist me into any kind of cruel or diminished person. For example, I started Noobwerks Engine as a healthy distraction. My love of clothwork also came from that period. Coding NoobWerkz helped make me into even more of an excellent programmer who writes correct, elegant, modular, and readable code. I am quite eager to work with nice people and make really cool things. When talking shop with other technologists everyone in the conversation, myself included, have learned that I am very much the real Mc'Coy. I am extremely confident a good software shop wants me around.</p>
		<h4>Languages</h4>
		<p>My first language is French but most people don't know that.</p>
		<p>Computer-wise, the first language I played with at age 12 was Perl, followed by HTML/CSS/JavaScript from the WebMonkey tutorials. Then I read Head-First Java 1.4 at age 14 and really enjoyed using the Swing GUI toolkit. Later on I did more hardware work and learned a lot of C/C++. Sometimes I'm amazed at what some people (ab)used that language to accomplish! I have also really enjoyed ARM assembly at university and I'm not at all afraid of diving right back into low-level work! Recently I've been scripting in Python a lot. Over the past few months I've been looking at Ada/SPARK, Rust, and CakeML as tools for writing extremely solid software. I have also lately been reading up on Isabelle/HOL for the purposes of learning formal verification.</p>
		<h4>TV/Movies/Media</h4>
		<p>This isn't usually part of someone's CV, but again; anyone who's hiring doesn't usually get much time to determine who somebody really is, and COVID doesn't help much in that regard. I may as well share this in order to help bring more visibility to the fore.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Detective series I really enjoy are Hamish McBeth and George Simenon's Maigret. If you can't get into the latter there is a simple two-step process: Learn French. Watch.</li>
			<li>The anime <i>Spirited Away</i> touched me deeply. I love anything by that genius Miyazaki.</li>
			<li>All of Katy Perry's music videos are amazing assemblies..</li>
			<li>HBO's <i>Rome</i></li>
			<li>Monty Python, BlackAdder, Red Dwarf, SNL (they're baaaad...)</li>
			<li>Deep Space, Rick/Morty, Family Guy and American Dad (I know... I know...), South Park (I'm defending that one), Simpsons.</li>
		</ul>
		<h4>Beliefs</h4>
		<ul>
			<li>Emotional cruelty should be outlawed and enforced against. Humanity will otherwise go catastrophically extinct.</li>
			<li>AI is both currently overhyped and underestimated. The long-term changes will still be fundamental, but they'll happen more quietly as it becomes normalized. In fact, its success will be marked by the fact that most people will hardly notice that it's involved! However, markets with high hopes run hot and that means boom-bust cycles. I predict that at least one large AI-based firm that overpromised and underdelivered to either tank or take a significant haircut with a resulting cooldown in investment money. Not just this time, but again, and possibly again. However, this will give time for AI to live up to its potential in a more "organic" manner, with far less social disruption than originally feared.</li>
			<li>Same as previous, but substitute "AI" with "blockchain." Isn't it interesting how usage patterns form around powerful technology?</li>
			<li>P != NP. Probably...</li>
			<li>If you find yourself asking "Why didn't someone build this important thing we need?" it's usually a cost issue.</li>
			<li>People often get too religious about technology, but high-quality open-source hardware and software is extremely important to the field. Having been bitten by poor firmware support for business-grade hardware made by top-tier vendors who should have done better, I have committed to never buy closed-source hardware if an open-source alternative exists. Due to my capacities I'd be able to assist at fixing firmware anyways.</li>
			<li>I will cheerfully work with all sorts of different people and groups, and will even do pro-bono for certain causes. However, I will not partake in socially toxic or criminal endeavours.</li>
			<li>The future of programming languages lies in formal verification; our own is predicated on how well we deploy human languages.</li>
			<li>Some people are beginning to doubt the USA's self-regenerative ability. I think the current situation signals the opposite; that the American people will come out stronger and more honest with themselves. I believe that the ability of the hard right to hold onto the narrative is already basically broken: Every prior American regeneration (Reconstruction, New Deal, Civil Rights) had previously permitted every underhanded trick to exclude black people and others deemed less than fully human. I think we may be finally witnessing the last real rally of white supremacy as society decides to turn its back on all its injustice and its horrors. More and more people are realizing that fiery anger isn't the only form of hatred: it can also be about dim evaluations of the intellect and moral fiber of entire populations. It is at its root about validating oneself by labelling another as degenerate. It is about telling people to "clean up" their accent. It is about the perceived need to change placenames that dare honour those who don't look and speak like oneself. It would be absolutely naive to think that everything will play out smoothly and without more violence, but as a whole America will be better off when the hatefuls are finally repudiated roundly enough to force them to stand down; make them hand over the excess power they've wielded over other's heads back to the public. Some of them will lie and obfuscate and others among them will wave weapons and threaten harm. Some will even carry out on these threats as we've seen with the recent rise in hate crimes. However, the rest of people will continue to condemn these bad actors and reject their poisonous ideology. The rest of the world is feeling the change. I think history will look back on the recent past as an expression of many problems that had previously swept under the rug.</li>		</ul>
