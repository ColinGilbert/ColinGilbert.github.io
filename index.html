		<h2>About</h2>
		<p>Hi! My name is Colin Gilbert. I am a computer programmer based in Regina, Saskatchewan.</p>
		<p>If you are reading this, odds are that you're either looking into my cool projects or deciding whether you or your firm wants me to work alongside you. I am <i>very</i> invested in my education and tend to become highly knowledgeable in fields that must be understood in order to fulfill other needs.</p>
		<p>Among the nicer things I have been called more than once: Good communicator, good teacher, good person, extremely bright, respectful, very intelligent, silly, brave, funny.</p>
		<h4>Contact information:</h4>
		<p>My email address for enquiries from the general public is: <a href="mailto:public.colingilbert@gmail.com">public.colingilbert@gmail.com</a></p>
		<h4>Credentials (obtained)</h4>
		<ul>
			<li>BSc. Computer Science, University of Regina. Regina, Saskatchewan, Canada. 2020</li>
			<li>High School Diploma. Mgr. de Laval. Regina, Saskatchewan, Canada. 2004</li>
			<li>A+ Certification. 2003</li>
		</ul>
		<h4>Credentials (currently working on)</h4>
		<p>Unlike some software devs, I believe that certs hold value if they are chosen carefully. Here is my current shortlist:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>CTT+ (Certified Technical Trainer), from CompTIA</li>
			<li>CAPM (Certified Associate in Project Management), from PMBOK</li>
		</ol>
		<h4>Experiences</h4>
		<p>This is where your prospective colleague will express the noteworthy things they've done over the past years: Hiring personel performing due diligence may notice a gap between milestones. I fell very ill for several years while nobody listened. For about half a decade I lived in a sort of suspended state with sub-marginal well-being. It then took another five years or so to relearn social skills and executive function, as these had been mostly tabula rasa'd by what had happened.</p>
		<p>However, from June 2016 to August 2017 I was the computer technician at London Drugs Harbour Landing in Regina. I was often roped in to sell, and was able to provide unexpectedly good service to customers expecting a lot less from me. It was there where I started learning how to speak with non-technical people. I also discovered a liking towards consulting - people wanted to see me specifically because they knew I was both honest and extremely knowledgeable. Talking to customers there also gave me ideas for various products and services I intend to offer someday.</p>
		<h2>Projects</h2>	
		<h4>NoobWerkz Engine</h4>
		<p>This thing is my pet. I  wrote this from the ground up in C++, and have taken out at least three times as much code as the project contains. This has been a very good project for someone wanting to tame complexity into elegance. This thing hasn't seen updates in while, but remains my goto-choice for code that I know will work well. It is very, very bare-bones, but as features it has: Full OpenGLES 3 support, a an extremelt flexible "gets out of your way" component/entity system, excellent all-purpose shaders that only take up constant space of texture memory (just tweak the parameters to obtain totally different results), no RTTI/exceptions, and no deep inheritance structures:  The vast majority of inheritance is as pure virtual functions that get final'd at definition-time. It also natively supports fun peripherals such as the 3DMouse and the Wacom tablet.</p>
		<p>It is currently still in its early teenage years: It needs refinement and additional abilities. Due to its data-oriented loop that preallocates the most possible it is already very stable, but I'd like to rewrite all parts of it that live on a server in a memory-safe language such as Rust or Ada/SPARK.</p>

		<h4>AutoGentoo</h4>
		<p>AutoGentoo is a set of Python scripts that do the repetitive work of building, packing, and compressing immutable system images. The generated kernels have rootfs packed right in as a linked initramfs. Will soon be using a sane and portable alternative to ZFS, plus functionality for packing filesystems for subsequent overlaying.
		<p>At this point it is mostly feature-complete and does what it should do. There will be a few backend changes and minor feature upgrades. Linux-wise, I believe Exherbo may fit my needs a bit more, as it seems to solve a few of the problems this toolset fixes. This fun little project may even become obsolete for me sooner than expected! Even if it does, I hope to leave it well-enough to make others happy to use it.</p>

		<h4>Fogget About It</h4>
		<p>This was my final year university project. It is a agricultural tool written in Java, specialized towards collecting and updating information from embedded systems running fogponics equipment. More specifically it specifies a data format, an MQTT-based messagfing system, a server-based frontend that runs on a Pi-like system (or bigger/better) and allows you to view state and update settings. It also has testing harnesses and scored 85% for the class, so I'm pretty happy with it. It also does not leak any references, nor memory.</p>

		<h4>Languages</h4>
		<p>My first language is French but most people I know socially don't know that.</p>
		<p>Computer-wise, the first language I played with at age 12 was Perl. This was followed by HTML/CSS/JavaScript from the WebMonkey tutorials. Then I read Head-First Java 1.4 at age 14 and really enjoyed using the Swing GUI toolkit. Later on I did more hardware work and learned a lot of C/C++. Sometimes I'm amazed at what some people (ab)used that language to accomplish! I have also really enjoyed ARM assembly at university and I'm not at all afraid of diving right back into low-level work! Recently I've been scripting in Python a lot. Over the past few months I've been looking at Ada/SPARK, Rust, and CakeML as tools for writing extremely solid software. I have also lately been reading up on Isabelle/HOL for the purposes of learning formal verification.</p>
		<h4>Good books that everyone in the field should read at least once</h4>
		<p>Some of these were university textbooks that were in some manner more useful than the rest. Others are extremely informative works the authors have freely made available online. The rest weren't freely available nor a part of curriculum, but I managed to obtain them anyhow.</p>
		<ul>
			<li><i>Concrete Semantics with Isabelle/HOL</i> by Nickpow and Klein</li>
			<li><i>Elements of Programming</i> by Stepanov and McJones</li>
			<li><i>Concepts of Programming Languages</i> by Sebesta</li>
			<li><i>Stewart's Calculus</i> by the late James Stewart. I wanted to personally thank him but never got to.</li>
			<li><i>Introduction to Mathematical Thinking</i> by Gilbert and Vanstone</li>
			<li><i>Practical Linear Algebra</i> by Farin and Hansford</li>
		</ul>
		<h4>Interests (professional)</h4>
		<ul>
			<li>Systems Programming</li>
			<li>Organizing data</li>
			<li>Building the most effective UIs</li>
			<li>Design and implementation of extremely reliable and secure hardware-software-network-process assemblies.</li>
		</ul>
		<h4>Interests (STEM-related)</h4>
		<ul>
			<li>3D printing, machining, automated assembly</li>
			<li>AI and Data Science</li>
			<li>Materials</li>
			<li>Trying to do things such as Kolmogorov complexity and exponential growth analyses on non-computer science concepts</li>
			<li>People's perceptions of technology vs. what it actually is</li>
		</ul>
		<h4>Interests (what I fancy)</h4>
		<ul>
			<li>Gardening</li>
			<li>Sewing, dyeing, tailoring, leatherwork, upholstery, felting. I will reliably nerd out for anything fabric-related.</li>
			<li>Cooking</li>
			<li>Music</li>
			<li>History. I've read that studying history makes you a better scientist, and I agree - understanding history is about finding the greater context, sometimes with mere scraps of information, from disparate sources. It also shows us with real examples how much information is needed to accurately piece together any kind of meaningful picture.</li>
			<li>Dogs. I'm a sucker for sweet floppy faces.</li>
		</ul>
		<h4>Things I'd like to do.</h4>
		<ul>
			<li>A public system to timestamp and sign small files, for the purpose of notarizing.</li>
			<li>A time-slicing OS written in a memory-safe language with strong formal modeling. While I do not wish to marry this to any specific technology or technique, it will likely use the underjack approach as well as careful memory access patterns to defend against memory unsafety, cache timing attacks, and rowhammer. Strict enforcement of dataflow will be established and enforced within each computer and across the network via ephemeral IP addresses, a strict encrypt-until-needed policy for everything except some public keys, and a Kerberos-like system plugged into a capabilities-based authorization database. Some dislike Kerberos due to the difficulties in integration and the network chatter it can cause, but if you do it right (more on that in a later post!) I contend it is more future-ready than most others (with justification in said post!)</li>
			<li>Offer coding lessons on YouTube.</li>
			<li>Learn pattern-drafting. Build a camera assembly that creates a point-cloud and turns it into pattern blocks. Make clothes for myself and friends.</li>
			<li>Make some nice blazers.</li>
			<li>Old-fashioned shoemaking.</li>
			<li>Paint on silk.</li>
			<li>Write, animate, and voice an online show.</li>
			<li>Make a machine that can assemble items made of diverse materials, as well as an automated feeder system that fetches, cuts, 3D-prints, etc.</li>
			<li>Create online strategy games of great depth and cultivate a fanbase of very intelligent people.</li>
			<li>Compile and share a database of my knowledge. Encourage others to contribute.</li>
		</ul>
		<h4>Beliefs</h4>
		<ul>
			<li>AI is currently both overhyped and understated. The long-term changes will still be fundamental, but they'll happen more quietly as it becomes normalized.</li>
			<li>Same as previous, but substitute "AI" with "blockchain." Isn't it interesting how usage patterns form around powerful technology?</li>
			<li>P != NP. Probably...</li>
			<li>If you find yourself asking "Why didn't someone build this important thing we need?" it's usually a cost issue.</li>
			<li>People often get too religious about technology, but high-quality open-source hardware and software is extremely important to the field. Having been bitten by poor firmware support for business-grade hardware, I have committed to never buy closed-source hardware again if an open-source alternative exists.
			<li>I will cheerfully work with all sorts of different people and groups and will even do pro-bono for certain causes. However, I will not partake in socially toxic endeavours.</li>
			<li>The future of programming languages lies in formal verification; our own is predicated on how well we deploy human languages.</li>
