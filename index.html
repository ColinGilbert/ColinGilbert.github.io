<h2>About</h2>
<p>Hi! My name is Colin Gilbert. I am a computer programmer based in Regina, Saskatchewan. When I was a kid I wanted to become the the best programmer of them all, and I still do. If you are reading this, odds are that you're either looking into my cool projects or deciding whether or not you wish to work with me.</p>
<p>Among the nicer things I have been called more than once: Good communicator, good teacher, good person, extremely bright, respectful, very intelligent, silly, brave, funny.</p>
<h4>Credentials (obtained)</h4>
<ul>
<li>BSc. Computer Science, University of Regina. Regina, Saskatchewan, Canada. 2020</li>
<li>A+ Certification, Comptia. 2003</li>
</ul>
<h4>Credentials (currently studying)</h4>
<p>Unlike some software devs, I believe that certs hold value if they are chosen carefully: They must feed into DevOps/IoT. Here are the ones on which I'm currently focusing my learning efforts:</p>
<ol>
<li>CAPM (Certified Associate in Project Management), from the PMI (Project Management Institute.) </li>
<li>PSEM (Professional Software Engineering Mastery), from the good ole' IEEE.</li>
</ol>
<h4>Credentials (aspirational)</h4>
<p>These are also good ones for someone to obtain; one may not be able to get all of them within a lifetime, but nobody is stopping you from trying!</p>
<ul>
<li>LPIC-3 Security (Linux Professional Institute Certification), from the LPI (Linux Professional Institute.)</li>
<li>CQPA (Certified Quality Process Analyst), from the ASQ (American Society for Quality.)</li>
<li>ISP (Information Systems Professional) from CIPS (Canadian Information Processing Society.)</li>
<li>CDP (Certified Data Professional) and CCP (Certified Computing Professional) from the ICCP (Institute for the Certification of Computing Professionals.)</li>
<li>CCBA/CBAP (Certified Capability in Business Analysis/Certified Business Analysis Professional) from the IIBC (International Institute of Business Analysis.)</li>
<li>SSCP, CISSP, and CSSLP from ISC2 (Information Security Consortium.)</li>
<li>CCSK (Certificate of Cloud Security Knowledge) from the CCSA (Cloud Security Alliance.)</li>
<li>CPRE (Certified Professional in Requirements Engineering), from the IREB (International Requirements Engineering Board.)</li>
<li>SBDE (Senior Big Data Engineer) and SDS (Senior Data Scientist) from DASCA (Data Sciences Council of America.)</li>
<li>CCNP from Cisco, with a focus on architecture.</li>
<li>AWS, GCP, Azure devops and architecture pathways</li>
<li>CWDP (Certified Wireless Design Professional), from the CWNP (Certified Wireless Network Professionals.)</li>
<li>CCNP (Cisco Certified Networking Professional) with a focus on architecture and service-provider specialties.)</li>
<li>CTT+ (Certified Technical Trainer), from CompTIA.</li>
<li>CAP (Certified Automation Professional) from ISA (International Society of Automation.)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Projects</h2>
<h4>NoobWerkz Engine</h4>
<p>This thing is my pet. I  wrote this from the ground up in C++, and have taken out at least three times as much code as the project contains. This has been a very good project for someone wanting to tame complexity into elegance. It remains my go-to choice for experimental code needing low-level hardware access. It is very, very bare-bones, but as features it has: Full OpenGLES 3 support, a an extremely flexible "gets out of your way" component/entity system, excellent all-purpose shaders that only take up constant space of texture memory (just tweak the parameters to obtain totally different results), no RTTI/exceptions, and no deep inheritance structures: The vast majority of inheritance is as pure virtual functions that get final'd at definition-time. It also natively supports fun peripherals such as the 3DMouse and the Wacom tablet. Due to its data-oriented loop that preallocates the most possible it is already very stable, but I'd like to rewrite all parts of it that live on a gameserver to Ada/SPARK or other formally-verified system, since the non-platform code already simply consists of state machines, message-passing, iterations, lookups, and inserts.</p>

<h4>AutoGentoo</h4>
<p>I use Gentoo. A lot. AutoGentoo is a set of Python scripts that do the repetitive work of building, packing, and compressing immutable system images. The generated kernels have rootfs packed right in as a linked initramfs. Will soon be using a sane and portable alternative to ZFS, plus functionality for packing filesystems for subsequent overlaying.
<p>At this point it is mostly feature-complete and does what it should do. There will be a few backend changes and minor feature upgrades. </p>

<h4>Fogget About It</h4>
<p>This was my final year university project. It is an automated agricultural management system written in Java. It specifies a data format, an MQTT-based messaging system, a server-based frontend that runs on a Pi-like system (or bigger/better) and allows you to view state and update settings. It also has testing harnesses and scored me 85% for the class, so I'm pretty happy with it. It also does not leak any references, nor memory.</p>

<h4>Languages</h4>
<p>My first language is French but most people with whom I interact socially have no clue.</p>
<p>Computer-wise, the first language I played with at age 12 was Perl. This was followed by HTML/CSS/JavaScript from the WebMonkey tutorials. Then I read Head-First Java 1.4 at age 14 and really enjoyed using the Swing GUI toolkit. Later on I did more hardware work and learned a lot of C/C++. Sometimes I'm amazed at what some people (ab)used that language to accomplish! I've got a favourite example - ask me about it! I have also really enjoyed ARM assembly at university and I'm not at all afraid of diving right back into low-level work! Recently I've been scripting in Python a lot. Over the past few months I've been looking at Ada/SPARK, Rust, and CakeML as tools for writing extremely solid software. I have also lately been reading up on Isabelle/HOL for the purposes of learning formal verification.</p>
