		<h2>About</h2>
		<p>Hi! My name is Colin Gilbert. I am a computer programmer based in Regina, Saskatchewan. When I was a kid I wanted to become the the best programmer of them all, and I still do. If you are reading this, odds are that you're either looking into my cool projects or deciding whether or not you wish to work with me.</p>
		<p>Among the nicer things I have been called more than once: Good communicator, good teacher, good person, extremely bright, respectful, very intelligent, silly, brave, funny.</p>
		<h4>Credentials (obtained)</h4>
		<ul>
			<li>BSc. Computer Science, University of Regina. Regina, Saskatchewan, Canada. 2020</li>
			<li>A+ Certification, Comptia. 2003</li>
		</ul>
		<h4>Credentials (currently studying)</h4>
		<p>Unlike some software devs, I believe that certs hold value if they are chosen carefully: They must feed into DevOps/IoT. Here are the ones on which I'm currently focusing my learning efforts:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>CTT+ (Certified Technical Trainer), from CompTIA.</li>
			<li>CAPM (Certified Associate in Project Management), from PMI.</li>
		</ol>
		<p>I am lukewarm towards computer security certifications as many of these things exist only to sell a product. A few years ago I read (and nailed all the practice questions) of the CWNA (Certified Wifi Networking Administrator) textbook only to find that the syllabus had been updated, so for my pride and my abilities (WiFi is everywhere...) I'm gonna get that one someday. Furthermore, I'd like to do the LPIC (Linux Professional Institute Certifications) series as they're excellent practice material for DevOps. If you are an employer who pays for certifications, please let me know!</p>
		<h2>Projects</h2>
		<h4>NoobWerkz Engine</h4>
		<p>This thing is my pet. I  wrote this from the ground up in C++, and have taken out at least three times as much code as the project contains. This has been a very good project for someone wanting to tame complexity into elegance. It remains my go-to choice for experimental code needing low-level hardware access. It is very, very bare-bones, but as features it has: Full OpenGLES 3 support, a an extremely flexible "gets out of your way" component/entity system, excellent all-purpose shaders that only take up constant space of texture memory (just tweak the parameters to obtain totally different results), no RTTI/exceptions, and no deep inheritance structures: The vast majority of inheritance is as pure virtual functions that get final'd at definition-time. It also natively supports fun peripherals such as the 3DMouse and the Wacom tablet. Due to its data-oriented loop that preallocates the most possible it is already very stable, but I'd like to rewrite all parts of it that live on a gameserver to Ada/SPARK. I am migrating towards being a framework.</p>

		<h4>AutoGentoo</h4>
		<p>I use Gentoo. A lot. AutoGentoo is a set of Python scripts that do the repetitive work of building, packing, and compressing immutable system images. The generated kernels have rootfs packed right in as a linked initramfs. Will soon be using a sane and portable alternative to ZFS, plus functionality for packing filesystems for subsequent overlaying.
		<p>At this point it is mostly feature-complete and does what it should do. There will be a few backend changes and minor feature upgrades. </p>

		<h4>Fogget About It</h4>
		<p>This was my final year university project. It is an automated agricultural management system written in Java. It specifies a data format, an MQTT-based messaging system, a server-based frontend that runs on a Pi-like system (or bigger/better) and allows you to view state and update settings. It also has testing harnesses and scored me 85% for the class, so I'm pretty happy with it. It also does not leak any references, nor memory.</p>

		<h4>Languages</h4>
		<p>My first language is French but most people with whom I interact socially have no clue.</p>
		<p>Computer-wise, the first language I played with at age 12 was Perl. This was followed by HTML/CSS/JavaScript from the WebMonkey tutorials. Then I read Head-First Java 1.4 at age 14 and really enjoyed using the Swing GUI toolkit. Later on I did more hardware work and learned a lot of C/C++. Sometimes I'm amazed at what some people (ab)used that language to accomplish! I've got a favourite example - ask me about it! I have also really enjoyed ARM assembly at university and I'm not at all afraid of diving right back into low-level work! Recently I've been scripting in Python a lot. Over the past few months I've been looking at Ada/SPARK, Rust, and CakeML as tools for writing extremely solid software. I have also lately been reading up on Isabelle/HOL for the purposes of learning formal verification.</p>
